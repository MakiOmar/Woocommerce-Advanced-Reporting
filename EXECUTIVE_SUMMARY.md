## 🔒 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed:

#### 1. Unauthenticated Data Access ❌→✅
**Before**: Any visitor could access reporting data  
**After**: Requires authentication + `manage_woocommerce` capability  
**Severity**: **HIGH** → **FIXED**

#### 2. SQL Injection ❌→✅
**Before**: Dynamic SQL with string concatenation  
**After**: Prepared statements with `$wpdb->prepare()`  
**Severity**: **HIGH** → **FIXED**

#### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ❌→✅
**Before**: Unsanitized note content  
**After**: `sanitize_textarea_field()` + output escaping  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM** → **FIXED**

#### 4. Missing Authorization ❌→✅
**Before**: No capability checks  
**After**: All endpoints check `manage_woocommerce`  
**Severity**: **HIGH** → **FIXED**

#### 5. Input Validation ❌→✅
**Before**: No validation on table names, IDs, statuses  
**After**: Whitelist validation, type checking  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM** → **FIXED**
